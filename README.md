# AceCoin Basic Cryptocurrency
A small project that demonstrates basic cryptocurrency functions for the cryptocurrency *AceCoin* such as transactions and rewards upon successfully mining a Block within the Blockchain itself. This Blockchain utilizes Proof-of-Work to prevent spammers. It's important to mention that this was created specifically to learn how exactly Blockchains work in relation to Cryptoscurrencies, which explains why it's considered to be labeled "basic".

The documented code for the Blockchain itself can be viewed in the main.js file to view how the basic cryptocurrency operates.
The project itself was programmed in JavaScript / Node.js.


# Mining Rewards Simulation

After the first block is mined in the Blockchain, it has a pending rewards to grant to the account address. If it successfully mines the next block it will receive the reward and have it added to the account balance itself. Each successful mining operation afterwards repeats this process.
